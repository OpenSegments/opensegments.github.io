# OpenSegments

A growing collection of demographic and socioeconomic classifications of populations. Classifications help businesses, governments, and researchers study and understand human populations. The OpenSegments project collects the methods necessary to create and vet a set of segmentation outputs to improve their use.

This repository is a collection of classification scripts and references to their inputs.

- See [openaddresses.io](http://blog.cartodb.com/open-segments/) for more information.

## Contributing segment names

Naming the outputs of segmentation scripts is difficult. Often the boundaries between two multidimensional clusters are challenging to interpret through simple language. We invite members of the community to identify and improve edge cases. Here is the process.

- Review the latest map or maps [LINK TO MAP INDEX]

- Identify the classification of interest and review the supporting material.

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/CartoDB/open-segments/issues/new) and give information about the segment you wish to rename a description of how it improves the interpretation of the supporting material.

- More details in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why open segments?

There are multiple commercial projects today that create and sell segmentation data to businesses and governments that make strategic decisions from what they contain. We believe that process deserves more transparent processes, where users can understand as clearly as possible the methodology of creating segments. That process can only improve through an open dialog and increased pace of research.
